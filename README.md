🚗 Car Sales Analytics Dashboard | Power BI
📌 Project Overview

The Car Sales Analytics Dashboard is an interactive Power BI report developed to analyze and monitor the sales performance of a car dealership company. This dashboard provides meaningful insights into overall sales trends, pricing performance, and the number of cars sold. It helps business stakeholders understand performance over time and supports data-driven decision-making.

🎯 Objective

The main objective of this project is to track key sales performance indicators in real time, analyze sales trends across different periods, regions, body styles, and colors, and identify growth opportunities as well as performance gaps within the business.

🛠️ Tech Stack

This dashboard has been built using Power BI Desktop for data visualization and report development. Power Query has been used for data cleaning and transformation, while DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) has been implemented to calculate KPIs, year-over-year growth, and comparison metrics. The project is developed using Power BI file formats such as .pbix and .pbit.

📊 Key KPIs Included

The dashboard includes important sales performance indicators such as Year-to-Date (YTD) total sales, Month-to-Date (MTD) total sales, year-over-year growth in sales, and the difference between current YTD sales and previous year-to-date sales. It also analyzes average price metrics including YTD average price, MTD average price, year-over-year growth in average price, and comparison with previous year pricing. Additionally, car sales volume metrics such as YTD cars sold, MTD cars sold, YOY growth in cars sold, and differences from previous year performance are included.

📈 Dashboard Visualizations

The dashboard presents a weekly YTD sales trend using a line chart to show how sales evolve over time. Sales distribution is visualized through pie charts that display YTD total sales by car body style and by color. Regional performance is highlighted using a map chart that shows YTD cars sold across different dealer regions. A company-wise sales trend is presented in a grid format to compare YTD sales among different companies. A detailed table is also included, providing complete information for each car sale such as car model, body style, color, sales amount, dealer region, and sales date.

🚀 Business Impact & Insights

This dashboard enables quick and effective monitoring of sales performance, helping stakeholders identify top-performing regions, popular car colors, and preferred body styles. It supports pricing strategy evaluation through average price analysis and assists management teams in strategic planning, forecasting, and performance optimization.
